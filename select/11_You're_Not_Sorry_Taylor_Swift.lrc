[00:14.47] All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
[00:20.91] I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
[00:28.06] And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
[00:35.08] And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around
[01:07.58] 
[00:41.29] You don't have to call anymore, I won't pick up the phone
[00:48.77] This is the last straw, don't wanna hurt anymore
[00:56.60] And you can tell me that you're sorry
[00:58.63] But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
[01:03.41] You're not sorry, no-no-no-no
[01:17.91] 
[01:18.71] You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
[01:25.58] Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
[01:32.50] And you've got your share of secrets, and I'm tired of being last to know, oh
[01:39.25] And now you're asking me to listen, 'cause it's worked each time before
[02:14.75] 
[01:45.35] But you don't have to call anymore, I won't pick up the phone
[01:53.15] This is the last straw, don't wanna hurt anymore
[02:01.15] And you can tell me that you're sorry
[02:03.08] But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
[02:07.82] You're not sorry, no-no-no-no
[02:15.32] You're not sorry, no-no-no-no
[02:29.82] 
[02:37.13] You had me crawling for you, honey, and it never would've gone away, no
[02:43.98] You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade
[03:12.48] 
[02:49.63] So you don't have to call (call), anymore (anymore), I won't pick up the phone
[02:57.10] This is the last straw, there's nothing left to beg for
[03:05.52] And you can tell me that you're sorry
[03:07.63] But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
[03:12.38] You're not sorry, no-no-no-no
[03:19.87] You're not sorry, no-no-no-no
[03:34.37] 
[03:26.85] No-no-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, no-no-no
[03:41.19] Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
[03:49.83] Oh-oh-oh-no-no
[03:59.37] No-no-no-no
